## About 

CompanyCMS is a simple CRUD website made with Laravel 6 that allows users to create an account add companies and manage company employees.

   * Basic Laravel login is used for creating accounts and authenticating users.  
   * Users can view, create, edit and delete their companies and employees. The admin of the website can view, edit and delete all companies and employees.  
   * Laravel's auth middleware is used for checking if the user is authenticated. 
   * A policy is used to verify is a user has permissions to access company and employee information. 
   * Database is seeded with records using factories and seeders.
   * A simple search for companies and employees has been implemented.  

## Basic Laravel Auth

Create basic Laravel auth: 
- `composer require laravel/ui --dev`
- `npm install && npm run dev`
- `php artisan ui vue --auth` - installs a layout view, registration and login views, routes for all authentication end-points and a HomeController.

## CRUD for Companies

### Create company

To create a new company 2 `CompanyController` methods are used:

- `create` -> returns view with form to create new company    

<details> 
<summary> store -> persists the new company in the DB  </summary> 

- validates the request attributes       
- persists the new company to the DB      

```php
// /app/Http/Controllers/CompanyController.php

// persists the company to the DB
public function store(Company $company, Request $request)
{
  // server-side validation
  $attributes = $this->validateAttributes();

  // sets attributes
  $attributes['user_id'] = auth()->user()->id;

  // persits to DB
  $company = $company->create($attributes);

  return view("companies.show", ['company' => $company]);
}
```
</details>


### Read company

<details>
<summary>View all companies </summary>

- checks if user is admin -> returns all companies ordered by latest added and paginates the results  
- if user is not admin -> returns all companies belonging to a specific user ordered by latest added and paginates the results  
- checks if a search has been performed and returns the paginated results of the search   
```php
// /app/Http/Controllers/CompanyController.php

// returns view with all companies
public function index()
{   
  // if user is admin returns all companies
  if (auth()->user()->isAdmin()) {

    $companies = Company::latest();             
  }
  // else returns the companies that belong to the user   
  else {

    $companies = Company::where('user_id', auth()->id())->latest();  
  }

  //checks if search was performed, returns companies that match
  if (isset($_GET['search'])) {

    $companies->whereRaw("UPPER(name) LIKE '%" . strtoupper($_GET['search']) . "%'");          
  }

  //orders by most recent and paginates the results
  $companies = $companies->paginate(10);
  
  return view('companies.index', ['companies' => $companies]);
}
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>Show one company  </summary>

- shows details of one company with the associated employees    
- checks if a search was performed and returns the results    
- if no search was performed returns all the employees  

```php
// /app/Http/Controllers/CompanyController.php

// shows one company
public function show(Company $company)
{
  // uses policy to authorize view
  $this->authorize('view', $company);

  //checks if search was performed, returns employees that match
  if (isset($_GET['search'])) {

    $employees = $company->employees()
        ->whereRaw("UPPER(first_name) LIKE '%" . $_GET['search'] . "%'"); 

  } else {
    // returns all the employees ordered by most recent and paginates the results 
      $employees = $company->employees()->latest();
  }

  return view('companies.show', ['company' => $company, 'employees' => $employees->paginate(10)]);
}
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>Display pagination in view </summary>

<div class="mt-3">

  return view('companies.show', ['company' => $company]);
}
```

</details>
